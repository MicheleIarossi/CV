# One page CV in LaTeX

This is a LaTeX template for generating a one page CV.

One of the main benefits of LaTeX is its capability of producing extremely neat, tidy and beautifully typeset documents. It makes absolutely sense to use it for writing its own resume as well.

The template `cv.tex` that you can download here is based on and inspired by the one page resume provided by Gayle Laakmann McDowell on her website https://www.careercup.com/resume. I have kept the same layout but reimplemented commands and enviroments in my own way.
The final result is more or less the same as the one from but obtained with simpler commands and environments.

Hope you like the CV and find it easy to use!

## Prerequisites

Since the CV template is provided as a LaTeX file, you need to:

- Install the latest MacTex distribution from https://www.tug.org/mactex/
- Install the Calibri font on your Mac
- Use XeLaTeX in TeXShop for typesetting the CV

Concerning the Calibri font, if you have MS Office installed on your Mac, you can copy the required font files (`cp Calibri*.ttf`) from this folder:
`/Applications/Microsoft Word.app/Contents/Resources/DFonts` to this one in your home directory `~/Library/Fonts`, from where the font will be automatically added to your font library and made available for MacTeX to use.
